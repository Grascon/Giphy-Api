# Giphy-Api

In this program you can search for animal gifs by either clicking on the animals created dynamically in the beginning with JQuery or searching new animals and clicking on the button that is created when searching for a new animal. When clicking the button the images are obtained using the giphy api and javascript/jquery. Ten images will be displayed and you must click on the image to start and pause the gif.

Credits for the code to be able to play/pause the gifs by clicking on them: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44298501/how-to-pause-and-start-gif-using-jquery-ajax
